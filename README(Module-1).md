Student Performance Regression - Module 1

Name: Touseef Ahmed

Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between student demographics and their math scores using **Multilinear Regression**.

Objectives
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Encode categorical data.
- Normalize features.
- Train a Multilinear Regression model.
- Evaluate the model using R² score.
- Visualize the results.

Dataset
- Source: Kaggle - Student Performance Dataset
- URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

Methods
- **Multilinear Regression** was used to predict math scores.
- Evaluation Metric: R² Score
- Categorical variables were one-hot encoded.
- Features were standardized.

Results
- R² Score is printed after training.
- A scatter plot compares predicted vs actual math scores.


Conclusion
This analysis provides insight into how factors like gender, test preparation, and parental education level influence student math scores.
